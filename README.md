Easiest way (maybe?) to collab remotely via premiere. 
For this to work we just have to keep the same file structure on our local devices. 

Everything I have was able to upload except for

1. Bare Credits.mp4
2. zucchini_script_red.mov

(Github have upload limit for files over 25MB now apparently)

Step 1 : clone the respository (this makes a copy on your local machine) <br>
Step 2 : copy "Bare Credits.mp4" into the "footage" folder (kredits/kredits/footage) <br>
Step 3 : copy "zucchini_script_red.mov" into the "text" folder (kredits/kredits/text) <br>

Once you've done that, you should be able to open the project "kredits.proj" in Adobe. 

LMK if it works :P
